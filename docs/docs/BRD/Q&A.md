## Interview Conclusion

The tourism company currently faces several challenges in managing their operations. Staff spend significant time and effort processing bookings and ticket sales manually, recording customer information on paper and traditional spreadsheet software, leading to risks of confusion or information errors.

Information about available routes and trips is also documented using paper and traditional spreadsheets, making it difficult to update new information and share with customers. Customers find it inconvenient to look up information about tours and lack sufficient information to make booking decisions.

This inefficiency and inflexibility in business processes has affected customer experience and the company's growth capability. The Tourist Management System (TMS) aims to address these challenges by:

1. **Digitizing Route and Trip Management**: Centralizing all route, attraction, and trip information in a database with easy update capabilities and real-time availability tracking.

2. **Streamlining Booking Process**: Automating booking workflows from search to confirmation, including seat validation, payment processing, and automatic email notifications.

3. **Improving Customer Experience**: Providing self-service features for browsing trips, managing bookings, tracking favorites, and making payments online, reducing dependency on staff assistance.

4. **Enhancing Staff Efficiency**: Equipping staff with tools to quickly process bookings, manage customer accounts, and access complete booking information to provide better support.

5. **Enabling Data-Driven Decisions**: Providing comprehensive reports and analytics to help management understand business performance, customer behavior, and optimize operations.

6. **Ensuring Data Integrity**: Implementing proper validation, constraints, and backup mechanisms to prevent data loss and maintain information accuracy.

The system supports three user roles (Customer, Staff, Admin) with role-based access control, ensuring appropriate permissions for each user type. With 54 use cases organized into 13 functional groups, the TMS provides comprehensive coverage of all tourism company operations from route planning to booking management and business reporting.
